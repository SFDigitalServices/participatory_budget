We have already identified and engaged with property owners at two locations where work could begin immediately; A building on the corner of Noe & 18th and a building on the corner of Church & 17th.

The Upper Noe Neighbors brought residents and merchants together to explore ways to strengthen the vitality of the Church Street commercial corridor and attract more customers to its businesses and signage was one of the options presented. Such signs are place-making, provide a visual signal of the availability of shopping and dining to those passing through, and serve as a photogenic centerpiece.

MISCI (pronounced “Misky”) is a new, evidence-based program that pairs undergraduate or high school students with older adults to build a relationship through a creative project they choose to complete together during regular meetings over the course of four months. Developed with physicians and scientists at UCSF and national experts in creative aging, this program is designed to combat social isolation in both younger and older participants. Social isolation and loneliness are key risk factors for developing chronic and terminal illnesses especially as we age.

Currently, the lower terrain of the Bernal Cut parallel to San Jose Ave. is unkempt with only invasive plants and weeds. This proposed addition of trees would provide a sound and pollution barrier from the automobile and trolley traffic, carbon sequestration at the source of carbon dioxide emissions, and a water catchment opportunity from both storm water and fog.</p>\n      corona_heights_community_garden_and_orchard_improvement: 'Corona Heights Community Garden and Orchard Improvement -- This proposal is to provide funding for the improvement of the Corona Heights Community Garden and Orchard. The community garden was recently renovated with the replacement of the original 1990’s raised beds but still needs resurfacing of the decomposed granite surface surrounding the beds. The orchard, which was planted in 2008, now needs fruit trees replaced and renovated. Educational signage and a pollinator hedgerow are also planned for the site.  These much needed improvements will not only benefit the visitors to the garden and orchard, but also help to meet the ADA specifications and much needed fencing and access improvements as agreed upon by the San Francisco Recreation and Park Department.'\n      diamond_heights_safety_wall_lighting: 'Diamond Heights Safety Wall Lighting -- This project proposal would be to install uplighting for the Diamond Heights Safety Wall. The San Francisco Historic Landmarks Commission recently identified the Safety Wall as an approved site for landmarking. There are six key areas of the sculpture that if lit at night would highlight the beautiful details of the historic sculpture as well as producing a dramatic entrance to the Diamond Heights neighborhood creating a sense of pride and bringing attention to the beauty of this notable sculpture.

The detailed survey will delineate the respective property lines in the field, so that the design development plans will accurately reflect ownership and constraints, such as planting setbacks that the SFPUC will require. Completing the boundary survey will advance the Glen Park Greenway by supporting the detailed design of safe, accessible pathways, and restoring native vegetation. The built-out Glen Park Greenway will be an attractive, maintained pedestrian route from Glen Park village and Glen Park BART station, to Glen Canyon Park and trails up to Twin Peaks, serving all of San Francisco.'\n      greater_buena_vista_green_benefit_district_engineers_report: |\n        Greater Buena Vista Green Benefit District Engineer’s Report -- <p>\n          A volunteer group of neighbors has been meeting regularly since April 2017 to focus on the planning and feasibility of establishing a Green Benefit District. This proposed district would include Buena Vista Park, Corona Heights, Mt. Olympus Park, and many stairways. The boundaries of the proposed district are Page Street (north), Divisadero/Castro (east), 17th Street (south), and Stanyan (west). A Green Benefit District allows individual property owners to vote to assess their own property at a fixed fee for 15 years in order to provide specific services related to open space within their district. The GBD will not replace city services but will provide extra services.</p>\n        \n          <p>\n            This funding would provide for the next step in establishing the Greater Buena Vista GBD, which is to obtain an engineer’s report. The engineer’s report provides an assessment methodology for the proposed district (i.e. how and on what basis each property is assessed). This step will be followed by presentation to the City Attorney and Board of Supervisors, and then an extensive public outreach effort and voting process.</p>\n      new_irrigation_system_for_pink_triangle_park: 'New Irrigation System for Pink Triangle Park -- The existing irrigation system at Pink Triangle Park has fallen into disrepair and is no longer in working order.

Currently neighbors have been organized to install planters with plantings and have empowered stewards that water and care for the planters. For an example see the Northwest corner of Ford Street at Noe Street. Funding would be utilized to expand this program across the neighborhood by recruiting merchants and residents to care for potted plants in front of their residence or place of business. Planters, dirt, and plants would be provided and delivered for free.'\n  public_safety:\n    '#type': checkboxes\n    '#title': 'Public Safety'\n    '#options':\n      diamond_heights_resilience_improvements: |\n        Diamond Heights Resilience Improvements -- <p>\n          The Diamond Heights neighborhood has a relatively large vulnerable population. Part of this is the result of people who live in single-family homes or condominiums who have reached retirement age, and the balance involves housing developments which cater to people with disabilities or who have limited resources. The neighborhood has been preparing for catastrophic events, such as earthquakes, major fires, or severe weather conditions that can stress large numbers of residents for over 9 years with the Resilient Diamond Heights (RDH) program, which is guided by the Mayor's Neighborhood Empowerment Network, (NEN). Plans have been written and a base group of volunteers trained through the SFFD Neighborhood Emergency Response Team (NERT) and the RDH Service Center.

Additionally, medical training for volunteer responders will be available.</p>\n        <p>\n          Survival and Rescue: Search and rescue tools, face masks, pry bars, flashlights, triage supplies, hacksaws, shovels, and utility shut-off tools.</p>\n        <p>\n          Communications: Emergency radio equipment and emergency power generators.</p>\n        <p>\n          Operations: Canopy tents and tarps for shelter, large neighborhood map, and other needed documents.</p>\n      no_butts_in_d8: 'No Butts in D8 -- This proposal seeks to cut down on cigarette butt litter in our parks and open spaces. Funding would go to implementing a pilot program in collaboration with the San Francisco Recreation and Parks Department. In order to preserve the natural beauty of the parks the proposal is to install “butt receptacles” strategically around park perimeters. The receptacles would be supplemented with eye-catching promotional materials, posters to be provided to businesses around the parks, and signage. With additional funds, giveaways, such as ‘pocket ashtrays’ would be produced and provided to volunteers and ‘friends of the park’ organizations to use during heavy traffic days as a way to promote good behavior.'\n      the_resilient_noe_valley_program_senior_disaster_prep: |\n        The Resilient Noe Valley Program & Senior Disaster Prep -- <p>\n          Resilient Noe Valley is seeking funding to craft and implement a resilience action plan that will advance the preparedness of the Noe Valley community at the individual, organizational and community levels.

This park is the most popular dog park in District 8, with hundreds of residents, dog walkers, and dogs visit the park every day. We believe a security camera will reduce vandalism, mischief, and misbehavior and improve the safety of every visitor experience, human and canine. It is believed the cameras would bring to a close malicious harm to visitors and property.
