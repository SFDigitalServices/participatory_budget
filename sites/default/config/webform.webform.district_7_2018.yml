One in each direction-where vehicles currently travel above the posted speed limit Over 35,000 vehicles travel along this portion of Brotherhood way daily. This will be an important Vision Zero Traffic Calming measure.'\n      taraval_trafic_calming: 'Traffic Calming on Taraval between 14th & Claremont- Cost: $21,000 -- Taraval between 14th and Claremont (Dewey Circle) is a straight 6-block section that has become a speedway, with no stop signs between 14th & Claremont. Our project proposal is to install speed humps on three (3) blocks along this stretch of Taraval Street as traffic calming devices to reduce the high speeds of vehicles traversing this section of east/west roadway. The Vision Zero High Injury Network includes Taraval west from Funston; this proposal fits well with the Vision Zero goal of preventing pedestrian and bicycle injuries and fatalities.'\n      pedestrian_safety_portola: 'Improving Pedestrian Safety at the Intersection off Portola Drive- Cost: $50,000 -- A channelization island, already approved by the SFMTA in 2009, but not yet funded. The proposed island, at the confusing intersection of Santa Ana, San Anselmo and 14th Avenue off Portola Drive, would clarify the right of way for pedestrians and drivers, so that pedestrians could confidently use the cross walks at this intersection, slow traffic and improve pedestrian safety.'\n      pedestrian_safety_panorama: 'Pedestrian Safety Enhancements near Panorama & Twin Peaks Blvd Cost: $25,000 -- This project would fund a traffic study in the area near the intersection of Panorama Drive and Twin Peaks Blvd (including the nearby area where pedestrian and automobile traffic enters Panorama from Midcrest Way) with a view to determining the most effective measures that could be taken to enhance the safe interaction of automobile traffic with pedestrians crossing Panorama in those areas.

We are in need of better traffic-calming measures for Myra Way. Please support the installation of speed cushions to reduce vehicular speeds to a safe level for the neighborhood and its visitors.'\n      traffic_calming_melrose: 'Melrose Avenue Traffic Calming – Cost: -- This project would install a two mid-block speed humps on Melrose Avenue between Gennessee Street and Mangels Avenue, where vehicles often travel well beyond the 25 mile per hour speed limit. This street is long and relatively flat, which allows drivers to build up speed, and has a bend with obscured visibility. This project would benefit residents in Sunnyside, Westwood Highlands, and Miraloma Park, especially the elderly and young children. It would also benefit all pedestrians (walkers, joggers,dog walkers), especially those who may not have access to a vehicle and walk to and from the bus stops along Monterey Blvd.'\n  culture:\n    '#type': checkboxes\n    '#title': Culture\n    '#multiple': 4\n    '#multiple_error': 'Select up to 4 projects from Culture'\n    '#description': 'Choose up to <em>4 projects</em> in this category'\n    '#description_display': before\n    '#options':\n      unity_plaza: 'Unity Plaza Events – Cost: $25,000 -- Activity Unity Plaza with events where neighborhood residents and visitors can shop, eat, listen to music and dance.

San Francisco suffers the highest rate of property crimes of any major city in America, with 25,000 auto burglaries in 2015 alone, plus thousands of package delivery and home burglaries.
