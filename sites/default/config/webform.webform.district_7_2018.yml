Vehicles often exceed the speed limit which is a danger for pedestrians, and bus users attempting to cross Yerba Buena. This location has no marked crossings, and is uncontrolled (no stop signs or traffic signals). These improvements will help reduce the risk to all that use this intersection.'\n      traffic_study_vicente_wanona_madrone: 'Traffic Study of the Five-Way Vicente/Wawona/ Madrone Intersection -- This proposal seeks $33,000 to fund an MTA traffic study at the dangerous 5-way intersection at Vicente Street, Wawona Street and Madrone Avenue to determine appropriate traffic calming which will enhance pedestrian and motorist safety. This large and complex intersection, one-half block west of the West Portal shopping corridor, serves as a major thoroughfare for cross-town commuter traffic. The hazardous nature of this intersection was first documented in the 2002 traffic safety study by the S.F. Department of Public Health, and both SFMTA and private traffic engineers confirm the ongoing need for updated solutions.'\n      ocean_avenue: 'Ocean Avenue Pedestrian Crossing Improvements -- To make Ocean Avenue safer for pedestrians, this project seeks to install a flashing beacon at the intersection of Ocean and Geneva avenues. The beacon would be operated by a signal push button, and would flash a yellow yield signal light when pedestrians use the crosswalk to cross Ocean Avenue.

Judson Avenue is a busy residential street that borders City College’s Ocean Campus.  In addition to school and commuter traffic, Judson is on the #43 Masonic bus route, and connects Sunnyside to Ingleside and Mission Terrace. Pedestrians cross Judson to access City College, and Sunnyside families cross Judson to access schools and services near Monterey Boulevard. Residents have requested measures to reduce speed and crosswalk improvements to improve safety for all road users.'\n      safer_routes: 'Safer Routes to School for Our Kids -- Students at Aptos Middle School and Commodore Sloat Elementary need safe walking routes to and from public transportation on Monterey Blvd., Aptos Ave., and Ocean Ave., as well as to their homes in neighborhoods adjacent to the school. The Aptos PTSA proposes multiple traffic calming measures and engineering improvements to increase safety for students and neighborhood residents.

Vision Zero should start with our children!'\n      mangels_foerster: 'Mangels & Foerster Crosswalk Proposal -- This proposal is to install a more prominent, visible continental style crosswalk on Mangels and Forrester.

It is an ideal setting for simple birthday parties or sophisticated adult gatherings. The plaza is an outdoor area available in a quieter natural setting that has easy access to play structures, courts, the field, and a barbeque grill.

The alley is a short-cut to avoid walking an extra block to get from Bella Vista to Myra, but the tree-shaded stairway is dark and especially hazardous to walk on foggy/overcast/rainy days.

Building on the success of nearby neighborhoods, Miraloma Park and Merced Extension Triangle, GWPNA would like to create and implement a customized disaster preparedness plan and establish a neighborhood emergency operations center.

Items include: Pop-ups, folding tables and chairs, lights, lanterns, search-and-rescue materials, first aid equipment, and communication devices. In a disaster these materials would be transported to a staging area. At the staging area, a field station would be established so that the neighborhood’s volunteer emergency-responders could begin response efforts in the community.
