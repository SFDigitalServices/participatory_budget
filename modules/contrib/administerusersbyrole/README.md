# Administer Users by Role

## SUMMARY
This module allows site builders to set up fine-grained permissions for
allowing "sub-admin" users to manage other users based on the target user's
role.  The module defines new permissions to control access to edit/delete
users and assign roles - more specific than Drupal Core\'s all-or-nothing
'administer users' and 'administer permissions'.  It also provides a
'create users' permission and fine-grained permissions for viewing users.
